Eco-Drainage Monitoring Web App

Description: 
The Eco-Drainage Monitoring Web App is an interactive platform that allows users to report drainage problems directly from their location. By taking and uploading a photo, users can submit real-time reports of clogged, damaged, or polluted drainage systems. Each report automatically pins the issue on an interactive map, complete with user-provided details and GPS coordinates.

Admins can then review, verify, and update the status of each report from “Pending” to “In Progress” or “Resolved” ensuring transparency and accountability. The app promotes community participation in environmental care and helps local authorities efficiently monitor and maintain drainage systems for a cleaner, safer, and more sustainable environment.
